# My Personal Readme

## Working hours :clock9:

I usually start my day at 9am, checking emails, slack messages and preparing for the regular London standup revising what I have done the previous day and what I am going to be working on the day. 

I tend to leave the office between 5.30pm and 6pm. Although I am flexible to leave a bit later if anything urgent comes up.



## P​o​i​n​t​s​ ​o​f​ ​co​nt​a​c​t :speech_balloon:

The points where you could contact me are email or slack. 

I check them both regularly during the day, but maybe using slack would be easier to have a conversation.



## How I like to work :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I like to work as part of a team. Collaborating with others and learn from them when I am working is key for me to grow as a developer. 

I am a big fan of pair programming and getting feedback of my work. 

I like contructive feedback, so feel free to tell me, at any point, what you like or I could improve in my work, and I am also very happy to provide you some feedback, if you ask for it. 



## Be mindful that... :chart_with_downwards_trend:

English is not my first language and I sometimes need some time to know how to express myself.

I am an apprentice and I am still developing my developing skills and I might not know everything.



## Please let me know if… :incoming_envelope:

You don't understand me and I will try to rephrase it as many times need it.
